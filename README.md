This project is an **CodeSpark Utility Hub**, a comprehensive web application that integrates five distinct tools into a single, user-friendly interface. Designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, the hub allows users to switch seamlessly between different utilities using a tabbed navigation system. The application is built using HTML, CSS (with the Tailwind CSS framework for styling), and JavaScript for all its interactive functionality.

### Core Features

* **Quiz Game:** An interactive quiz that fetches new questions from the Open Trivia Database API. This ensures a fresh and challenging experience every time you play. The game tracks your score and provides immediate feedback on your answers.
* **To-Do List:** A persistent task management tool that helps you stay organized. You can add, mark as complete, or delete tasks, and your list is saved locally in your browser, so it will be waiting for you when you return.
* **Countdown Timer:** A versatile timer that lets you set a countdown for any future date and time. It displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, making it perfect for tracking important events and deadlines.
* **Live Weather Forecast:** A simple weather checker that uses the `Wttr.in` API to provide real-time weather information for any city you enter. It displays the current temperature, conditions, and an icon, helping you plan your day.
* **Tip & Bill Split Calculator:** A practical tool for dining out. It calculates the tip amount and the total cost per person based on the bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people, making it easy to split checks fairly.

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of front-end development by combining multiple functionalities into a single, cohesive, and responsive application.
